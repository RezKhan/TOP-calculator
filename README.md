# TOP-calculator

Creating calculator from TOP

Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42. 

Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). Your calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-).

You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.

Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!

Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”

Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!
